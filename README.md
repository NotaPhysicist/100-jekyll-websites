#100-jekyll-websites

This project represents not so much a Jekyll website template repository than a record of my odyssey into the labyrinth of frontend website UI design and implementation.

I glibly named this repository, **100 Jekyll Websites**. It is in fact a series of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based website templates that start simple simple, often using tutorials and course projects as a base, and build in complexity and content as my skills and experience grow.

Practicality, while always in mind, takes a backseat to the main ambition of showcasing design and the implementation of different technologies and techniques.

I've started a separate project for [web apps].
